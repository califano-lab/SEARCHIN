# SEARCHIN

##  Systematic Elucidation and Assessment of Regulatory Cell-to-cell Interaction Networks (SEARCHIN)

## Description

This tutorial guides you through the application of the SEARCHIN methdology for the identification of cell-to-cell ligand-receptor interactions responsible for mediating non-cell-autonomous communication mechanisms. 

## Schematics of the Methodology

## Introduction

### Using SEARCHIN - Example
To reproduce the manuscript findings, you only have to load the libraries and run one command after having loaded the input data.

#### Pipeline Commands



 The **first step** consists in setting a seed for the random number generator that allows us to reproduce the code in the same way 

```R
rm(list = ls())
set.seed(666)
source("libs/searchin-class.R")	# Load SEARCHING libraries and utilities
.isNeo4jServerOffline <- TRUE	# Flag this as FALSE if you have installed the Neo4j server or if you want to run SEARCHIN with your own data: you need the server with the PPI data running

# Loading input data
tmp <- read_csv("input/putative_ligands_mouse_new_data_jul2019.txt",col_types = c("cccccccc"))
ligands_list <- tmp$GeneSymbol
modulators_table <- read_csv("input/cindy-analysis.csv", col_types = "ccd")
receptors_table <- read_delim("input/viper-analysis.csv", delim = "\t" , col_types = "ccdddd")
```
Here is how to run the pipeline as one command-only line of code that performs all the steps in cascade. However, each step can be performed as separate individual line of code.

```R
my_sin <- SEARCHIN() %>% 
  addLigandslist(ligands_list) %>% 
  addModulatorTable(modulators_table) %>% 
  addReceptorTable(receptors_table) %>% 
  runModel() %>%
  generateRank()
```

By printing the SEARCHIN object, you can see the table content with the ranked ligand-receptor interaction inferred by the algorithm.

##### Output Example

```shell
> my_sin
An object of class SEARCHIN 
------------------------------
>>> Using 69 ligands
>>> Using 214 modulators
>>> Using 873 receptors
>>> Using 1503 PPIs interactions

#### Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) empirical null model using PrePPI

We used Neo4J Graph Database Community Edition version 3.2.5 to build a network of human protein interaction consisting of 20,259 proteins and 203,952,081 interactions with a total store size of 14.28 GB.

#### Generation of the VIPER table used as input data

Here is the code to generate the VIPER table:
